-Docker compose problem fixed
# Update 19/07/2020
-All microservices are communicating between each other.
-More setup is needed in the MVC project in the controllers, models and view in order for the system to work correctly.
-In order for the docker-compose file to work, it needs to be plased one directory out of the solution. There is a path problme with it that i have to solve.

Microservices Architecture Essentials: Exercises
Problems for exercises and homework for the Architecture of ASP.NET Core Microservices Applications course.
You should create a repository on GitHub, push your source code there, and link it here:

1.	Server-Side Application
Create a web application of your choice by using ASP.NET Core 3.1. It can be anything you like â€“ a blog, an online shop, an ad system, a social network, etc. You can use API + a JavaScript client or just plain MVC. 
â€¢	The project should have authentication and authorization functionality.
â€¢	The project should have at least 5 database tables, including users. 
â€¢	The project should have at least 10 endpoints.
â€¢	The project should have an administration. It may be a separate application.
â€¢	Do not overengineer your projectâ€™s architecture. Keep it as simple as possible. You may introduce a simple service layer, but it is not required. 
â€¢	This exerciseâ€™s focus is on external architecture, so do not invest too much time making the perfect web app. Do it as an urgent freelance project â€“ working, but without top code quality. ðŸ˜Š
2.	Client-Side Application
If you know a front-end JavaScript framework (Angular, React, Vue, etc.), it is strongly advised to use a Web API + a front-end JS client. It is the preferred microservices approach in terms of performance and scalability. Keep the front-end application in a separate project and process. If you do not know a front-end framework, just create your project as a single ASP.NET Core MVC server. You are going to use the MVC framework as a presentation layer in front of the microservices. This is a perfectly fine and viable production-ready solution, but it is a bit slower than the other approach in terms of throughput.
